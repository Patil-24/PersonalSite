          <p>(C,C++,Javascript,intermidiate JAVA).
            i started learning programming 2020 in lockdown perid
            i faces so many
          dificuities in initial days one i started and continiously working on my skills thats helps me a lot
        and i initialy suggest a students who are thinking about programming or coding for them i stongly

          “The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.”
― Donald E. Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science

          “Well, Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you *play* with them. They are so wonderful. You have these switches - if it's an even number you do this, if it's an odd number you do that - and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine.

After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn't paying any attention; he wasn't supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly - while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it would print columns and then bitsi, bitsi, bitsi, and calculate the arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole table in one operation.

Absolutely useless. We *had* tables of arc-tangents. But if you've ever worked with computers, you understand the disease - the *delight* in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing.”

          <p>“Cricket as a passion is distinctly contagious.”
” Enjoy the game and chase your dreams. Dreams do come true! “
“Cricket is the only sport in the world where you are absolutely horrible at something and you still need to go out and do it. “
“Cricket is quite a gentle, harmless game, but he is a lucky man who has not to sweat some blood before he’s done with it.”
“As far as the World Cup is concerned, it is a process. We don’t want to jump to the 50th floor straight away. We must start on the ground floor.”

        <h3>Some Good Thoughts</h3>

        <p>"Having imagination, it takes you an hour to write a paragraph that, if you were unimaginative, would take you only a minute.
          Or you might not write the paragraph at all." ~ Franklin P. Adams</p>
          <p>
            "At one time I thought the most important thing was talent. I think now that the young man must possess or teach himself,
             training himself, in infinite patience, which is to try and to try until it comes right.
              He must train himself in ruthless intolerance-that is to throw away anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that paragraph.
              The most important thing is insight, that is to be-curiosity-to wonder, to mull,
               and to muse why it is that man does what he does, and if you have that,
               then I don't think the talent makes much difference, whether you've got it or not."
               ~ William Faulkner
